#  Adobe Hackathon 2025 - Round 1A: PDF Outline Extractor

## Challenge Overview

The goal of this project is to automatically extract a **structured outline** from any given PDF.  
Specifically, the solution extracts:

- **Title**
- **Headings** with levels:
  - H1
  - H2
  - H3
- Each heading is tagged with its **page number**

This outline is returned in a valid JSON format and will be used as the base for later stages in the hackathon.

---

##  Problem Statement

Given a PDF of up to 50 pages:

- Detect the **Title** and structured headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Output the result as a valid JSON file
- Should work **offline** and be run **inside Docker**
- **No network**, **no APIs**, and **model (if used) â‰¤ 200MB**

---

##  Key Features

- Extracts:
  - PDF Title (from filename)
  - Headings and subheadings (H1, H2, H3) using text + font size
  - Page numbers for each heading
- Produces clean, hierarchical JSON format
- Works **offline**
- Fully Dockerized
- Compatible with AMD64 (CPU only)

##  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9**
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)** â€“ for PDF parsing
- **Docker** â€“ to containerize and run the solution offline
- **VS Code** â€“ development environment

---

##  Setup Instructions

### ðŸ”¹ Prerequisites

Make sure these tools are installed:
- Python 3.9+
- Docker Desktop (for AMD64 CPUs)
- Git
- VS Code (recommended)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Run Locally (Without Docker)

1. Open terminal in the root project folder
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

---
### ðŸ”¹ Run with Docker (As Required for Submission)
1. Build Docker Image:
   ```bash
    docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t pdf-extractor:submission .
2. Run Docker Container:
   ```bash
    docker run --rm \
      -v ${PWD}/app/input:/app/input \
      -v ${PWD}/app/output:/app/output \
      --network none pdf-extractor:submission

##  Approach
- Used PyMuPDF to parse PDF pages and extract text spans
- Based on font size, classified text blocks into:
      - H1 â†’ Larger size (typically > 17)
      - H2 â†’ Medium (14â€“17)
      - H3 â†’ Small headers (11â€“14)
- Avoided relying only on fixed fonts or positions to keep it general
- Output structure is created using Python dictionaries and dumped as JSON
